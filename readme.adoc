[#introduction]
== Introduction
A basic repository to collect Linux dot-files and useful custom scripts to include in the `bash` Terminal.


== Motivation

The typical motivation fo these kinds of repos, synchronise the .dotfiles across all systems.
However, I will also use this repo to sync some useful scripts I want to use across systems. (Although I guess this is also things ppl do with these :wink:)
